# Content-Monetization-Modeler


A machine-learning dashboard that predicts YouTube ad revenue using video performance metrics.  
Built with **Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Streamlit | Plotly**.



## 📘 Project Overview


Video creators and media companies rely on platforms like YouTube for income.  
This project builds a **Linear Regression model** that estimates `ad_revenue_usd` from metrics such as views, likes, comments, and engagement.  
A **Streamlit** allows users to interactively test inputs and explore insights.


## 🧠 Key Skills & Concepts


- Regression Modeling (Linear Regression)  
- Feature Engineering & Data Cleaning  
- Missing Value Handling 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Categorical Encoding  
- Model Evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE)  
- Data Visualization with Plotly  
- Streamlit Development


## 🗂️ Dataset

**Name:** YouTube Monetization Modeler  
**Rows:** ~122 000  
**Target Variable:** `ad_revenue_usd`



## ⚙️ Workflow
